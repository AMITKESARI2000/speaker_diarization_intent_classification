[00:00.10 - 02:10.62] speaker_0: nobody has more respect for women than i do nobody donal trump has tried repeatedly to grill hillary clinton about her husband's relations with other women and her reaction but the new york millionaire was on the hot seat this timee and started kissing the open mouthed as he was palming m towards him facing a slew of accusations from women who say he kissed groped and harassed them in the final debate it triggered a series of claims number one thos sohas had been largely debunked certainly tromp has swated down almost all the accusation saying he doesn't do such things and he did not with these women but a denial is not the same as a debunking there has been no wholesale dismissal of their charges by people outside the campaign so his statement is false claim to where he said that he could not possibly have done ah those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for i didt necessarily i thought did not say that but tromp has called one of the women disgusting about another he said she would not be my first choice and about a people magazine reporter who says he sexually assaulted her more than a decade ago look at her look at her words you tell me what you think i don't think so clinton's claim appears true trumps denial false and a third claim how all these accusers came to light i have a feeling how they came i believe it was her campaign that did it it's clenton's fault what we know is the scandal started with an old tape of trumps luwe commens recorded by access hollywood then some women saw him denying to our anderson cooper he'd ever do what was described on that tape i as a band but i have tremendous respect to whom have u ever had on the line have respect for me and i will tell you no i have not and i jumped off of my couch ana sighe kirolier and the accusations kept flowing from there if the clinton team is in any way involved in all this it's certainly not been proven yet so that part of trum's claim is false too
